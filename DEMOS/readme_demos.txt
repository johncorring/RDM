There are three demos here:
chickenDemo -- takes in two chickens, one is oriented one is not. Runs RDM on them and gets a registration and a normal estimate.
chickenDemo_fixed -- same as above but both chickens are oriented and RDM runs without the normal estimation
chickenDemo_tps -- uses a different motion model. Currently this is set to match point-sets. This is probably the most common
usage of this algorithm in the past and reduces to GMMReg.
